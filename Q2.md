Question 2
(i) Memory Location - Arrays have a fixed memory allocation thus classified under static data structure whereas Linked lists allow room for memory expansion
thus classified under dynamic data structures.
(ii) Performance - Arrays in terms of access speed, fast access to elements by index is required directly O(1)  whereas linked list, sequential access
is required O(n)
(iii). Insertion and Deletion : In arrays, Insertions and deletions are infrequent and mostly at the end whereas Linked lists, Frequent insertions and 
deletions are needed, especially at the beginning or middle.
